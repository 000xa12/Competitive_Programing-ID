A Discovery

While turning through the fields one fine day with his favorite rotary
plough, Farmer Arepo struck upon something quite odd: a square stone
tablet with strange symbols carved into it... he knew some such objects
could portray the same message in four different directions all at once,
so he wisely kept it for later examination and dutifully resumed working
the rich soil. As he wheeled on, he found more such tablets, but with so
many crops to sow, he had no time for deciphering their many glyphs.

Your Task

Please help Farmer Arepo by reading each tablet to discern whether or
not it is a Sator Square!

The Square . . .

    is known as a two-dimentional palindrome observing four symmetries

    can be read:

    top-to-bottom
    bottom-to-top
    left-to-right
    right-to-left

    can be rotated 180 degrees and still be read in all four directions

    ( may contain similar looking characters that are different, so be careful )

    is shown here illustrating how you can read the word "TUBA" in four different directions...

          v
      B A T S
      A B U T <
    > T U B A        
      S T A B
        ^

...and as such, every other word in the square can be thus read!
Input

size_t n                 //  length of each word (2 <= n <= 33)
const char tablet[n][n]  //  two-dimentional array of characters 

Output

true or false  //  whether or not the tablet is a sator square

Enjoy!
